It sounds like there might be an issue with your code editor or the file permissions. Here are a few things you can check:

1. **File Permissions**: Ensure that the file is not set to read-only. You can check the file properties and make sure you have write permissions.

2. **Editor Settings**: Sometimes, the editor might be in a mode that prevents editing. Check if the editor is in read-only mode or if there are any settings that might be causing this.

3. **File Lock**: Ensure that the file is not open in another program that might be locking it.

4. **Syntax Errors**: If there are syntax errors in the code, some editors might highlight the entire file in red. Make sure your code is syntactically correct.

If you still face issues, try creating a new file and see if you can edit it. If the problem persists, it might be an issue with the editor itself.
